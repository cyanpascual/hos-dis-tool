                    <p className="welcome__text">The Tracing for Allocation of Medical Suppliers or known as TrAMS is an initiative of the UP College of Engineering (UPCoE) together with the 
                      UP Department of Geodetic Engineering (UPDGE) as response to the ongoing crisis of our health care system against COVID-19. The TrAMS project is
                      part of Project 3: Tracking-High Risk Individual (headed by Dr. Ariel C. Blanco) and is currently led by Asst. Prof. Roseanne Ramos and 
                      Asst. Prof. Ransie Joy Apura with team members from the UP Society of Geodetic Engineering Majors (UPGEOP).</p>
                    <h3 className="welcome__subtitle">Our Goal</h3>
                    <p className="welcome__text">TrAMS is an online geographic and information tracking system which aims to properly allocate medical resources (such as alcohol, sanitizing agents, 
                      masks, gloves, etc.) to health facilities in the country. This system will serve as platform for government agencies, donors and other interested 
                      parties to efficiently distribute resources on hospitals with much-needed supplies.</p>
