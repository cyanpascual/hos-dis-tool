                  UP Department of Geodetic Engineering (UPDGE) as response to the ongoing crisis of our health care system against COVID-19. The TrAMS project is
                  part of Project 3: Tracking-High Risk Individual (headed by Dr. Ariel C. Blanco) and is currently led by Asst. Prof. Roseanne Ramos and 
                  Asst. Prof. Ransie Joy Apura with team members from the UP Society of Geodetic Engineering Majors (UPGEOP).</p>

                <p className="welcome__text">TrAMS is an online geographic and information tracking system which aims to properly allocate medical resources (such as alcohol, sanitizing agents, 
                  masks, gloves, etc.) to health facilities in the country. This system will serve as platform for government agencies, donors and other interested 
                  parties to efficiently distribute resources on hospitals with much-needed supplies.</p>

                <p className="help__left">Hospitals can be classified based on their current capacity on medical supplies. Filter by supply works by choosing a certain supply 
                  (alcohol, disinfectant, sanitizing kits, PPE,etc) and a supply level category (whether chosen supply is well-stocked, low or critically-low in stock).</p>

                <p className="help__right">To access information on selected hospital, location marker must be clicked first. Information includes hospitalâ€™s address, 
                  their designated contact person and contact details and their inventory on medical supplies.</p>

                <p className="help__left">Other facilities such as markets, convenience stores, gas stations and transport terminals can also be viewed on the map once a hospital is selected. </p>
